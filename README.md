Assignment 5 in Machine Learning class

The 'Assignment5-text-analysis.ipynb' file is divided into section based on the flow:
1.Data Processing: Data loading, cleaning, spliting and Feature Selection.
2.Model Selection: Initialization of dictionary of base models classifiers and a stacking ensemble of classifiers.
3.Model Training, Evaluation and Hyper-Parameter Tuning: Training our selected models, tuning our parameters accordingly for each classifier, and evaluating each model using cross validation and different parameters. 
4.Model Testing: Using our trained models on the test data, printing the requested predictions and writing our prediction results into 'classification_results.csv'.
